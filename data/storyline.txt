			`On your descent you are provided with a fantastic view of the surrounding city, everything has a sort of overwhelming industrial appearance. Though offset by the distinct lack of pollution in the air, it is a sight to behold. Even more perplexing is the magnitude of the ringworld; you can't begin to fathom the amount of work it would take to create even this small, tightly knit portion of the ring.`
			`	Being greeted by a large group of security personnel on landing has you uneasy, even more so with the escort of several security drones. The one leading the group advances towards you slowly, and says something in an alien language that you do not understand. Noticing your expression, they offer a small metallic device, presumably some sort of translation device.`

			`	After taking the device, the group turns and begins to walk away from you, that was a quick meeting. You should try to find some place that could tell you about what you've just taken.`

			`When landing back on the massive ringworld, it is no less impressive as it was the first time around.

			`Among the commotion of the Hai you feel just as the they all claim to be; you feel at peace here even under all the noise, it is not hard to see why so many Humans visitors have not chosen to return to where they came from. In the delay of waiting for the spaceport coordinator to process your visit; a divide in the crowd forms, it is one of the elders of the council, you would recognise the bright embezzled uniforms among any crowd. Waiting patiently alongside the line of humbled onlookers, the elder invites you to join him in a quiter location, a local office chambers of sorts.`
			`	"Tranquil in our ports is it not? I often find solace in walking amongst the masses." says the elder of the Hai whilst leading you into an area normally restricted for captains, all while attracting all kinds of odd looks from those who cannot figure out what interest an elder has in a ship captain. "Where are you bringing me? I don't get the impression that elders often have chats with civilian captains," you question. He quickly responds, "I thought you would have guessed from our last encounter. We have a delicate matter that may require an outsiders touch, and you proved very helpful last time."`
			choice
				`	"Have the pirate raiders returned then?"`

					goto "snarky"
			`	"No, no they haven't; this matter is of greater urgency," he says, "one that requires delicate political handling between two neighboring species." You have to ask, "But if this is political and so urgent, why am I here? I'm just a ship captain, one of a species not involved in either side of this."`
			`	He responds, "That may just be what we need to aid in negotiations, a mediator not involved in the matter, not to mention a sort of representative of the comparatively larger Human territories"`

				`	"I'll have to trust you on my worth in the negotiations, but I'll help."`

			label "snarky"
			`	He stops walking right as you approach a flight of stairs, and turns to meet your gaze. "Forgive me, I didn't mean to imply expectation," he says, "I would only like to run through the situation with you, if you would?". "What form does the latest emergency take on?" you ask, "A slight diplomatic crisis between the Hai and a humble species known as the Irm" he responds.`

			`	He let out a boisterous laugh before exclaiming, "I do appreciate humor among those around me, to find joy in talks of dire times is desirable. Today it may be slight, but anything that threatens the long standing peace we have maintained is a crisis to anybody proactively looking towards the future of those generations we may leave in our departure."`
			`	"What is it that happened exactly, what do you need of me?"`
				goto "explain"
			label "irm"
			`	"I didn't expect you to know of them, we try not to expose our neighbors as they prefer their isolation." he says, "In saying that however, they are not difficult to stumble upon on ones own."`
			`	You respond, "Well, I haven't stumbled onto any species who go by "Irm", "Well, the path leading into their territory shares the path into our space, there happens to be a second wormhole in the Waypoint system.." he trails off before giving a look as if needing to clarify, "I feel as if it is necessary to inform you as to where they reside, in the case you choose to assist us."`
			choice
				`	"Why don't you tell me what exactly happened?"`
				`	"I'm sorry, I'm not interested in getting in the middle here."`
					decline
			label "explain"
			`	He gives a look of deep thought, as if trying to find the words on how to phrase the situation. "What happened recently was not the doing of the Unfettered, and to our knowledge no crime of intent. It sparked when a Human and Hai crewed merchant vessel was caught by pirates on the return from a trade run through the Desolation Trail.." Abruptly he cut off and side tracks to clarify, "That is the title attributed to the perilous pathway that allows travel between our two territories, well, that has been the title for all the trail runners anyway for longer than I've been elder."`
			`	"But what more of the incident?" You ask`
			`	He continues "Oh yes, well after their travels along the trail and found themselves in pursuit by pirates, the lead they maintained ahead was thinning according to helpless onlookers. They made it through to Waypoint, that much was certain by the reports. It's unclear why exactly  they were unable to retreat into central Hai space but regardless, they found themselves traveling through the second wormhole into Irm space, the rest of what we know is piecemeal of what the Irm have disclosed. We do know that whatever happened on the other side of that wormhole did not do us any favors, they demand negotiations with our council, much of which has departed rather recently. I insisted on staying to focus on more terrestrial matters, however I've been informing myself on your doings within our space and of what I know of your significance within Human space, I believe your curiously intermeddling touch could be of use."`
			`	"Please travel to the Solum system and tell them Kaiya sent you and that you are to participate in the negotiations. the Irm may not be willing include you in this but make sure they tell the elders I sent you, they will request for you once they know I sent you."`
