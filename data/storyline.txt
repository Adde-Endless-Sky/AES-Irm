			`On your descent you are provided with a fantastic view of the surrounding cityscape, everything has a sort of overwhelming industrial utilitarian appearance. Though offset by the distinct lack of pollution in the air, it is a sight to behold. Even more perplexing is the magnitude of the ringworld; you can't begin to fathom just how incredible the capabilities of this structure is. It could surely be home to entire species without any manner of difficulty.`
			`	Once you finally find a platform that can adequately fit your ship on it, you make quick work of the landing procedure and disembark. Eager to solve the looming mystery of what exactly this place is, you almost rush out without your emergency suit to protect you. Unlike making contact with the Quarg or Hai, you feel an ounce of angst weighing you down. Before you were surrounded by troves of other humans unphased by the relative situations, now you feel nothing but alone in this discovery.`
			`	Your suit indicates that the area has a suitable atmosphere and so you remove your helmet and sling it behind your head. The platform your ship rests on is devoid of any protruding structures or obvious paths, large grooves in the edges of the foundation disrupt the otherwise bare surface. You make it a small distance from your ship before you hear the sound of engines overhead; a pair of ships are descending the skyline in a spiral towards the platform before they pitch their ships to a vertical orientation and descend more delicately. Landing aside the platform lodged into the edges grooves, the newly in place vessels tower above you far into the sky even with the bulk of the vessels resting beneath the platform.`
			`	After a short wait in the absence of company, a group finally approaches you from behind the cover of the vessel. Remarkably human in appearance, you almost instinctively call out to them expecting them to understand you but decide to stay silent. One walks ahead of the rest and they wait further behind, the one who meets you face to face offers a spherical device and makes a sort of gesture for you to do something with it.`

				`	(Take the device.)`
					goto "take"
			`	"My name is <first> <last>, I come in peace." They show no sign that they understand you, it seems that nothing has been translated. They make the gesture yet again.`
			choice
				`	(Take the device.)`
			label "take"
			`	After taking the device, the group turns and begins to walk away from you, that was a quick meeting. You should try to find some place that could tell you about this place.`

Although they seem to despise cooperating with other species presumably due to a lack of trust and no willingness to give them the chance to prove their trust, they have traded with the Hai before and continue to work towards a future where they can continue to benefit from their relationship, they mention having observed the rise and fall of the mighty Hai empire.`

Some few who find our home have had similar vague questions, so you may well know just as they were let known, we do well with what we possess in difference to what surrounds us. You should know that mostly we don't encourage trading with those from outside, so we cannot offer to do more than to keep your ship fueled and allow material trade."`

			`	"Yes, though not through our discovery, they met us. At the beginning they threatened us and had extorted us of our resources, a time where we had not yet even discovered the atom. For very many centuries since, we have had peace with our past bullies, our reparation talks with the peaceful Hai were extensive, they do not permit their kind to wander here, and they do not tell of our existence to outsiders, like them we mean to keep peace and this has earned us their favor."`
			`	"I am not personally aware of the events that took place to calm the conquesting Hai but perhaps it can be an example to others. Now, what is it you are here for?"`

				`	"I'm just passing through."`

			`	"We have very few 'tourists' here on Arx, I anticipated the feat of engineering that is our home to draw visitors however. Whichever is the cause for the lack of traffic, it doesn't matter, we have matters that take priority over tourism. If you wish to explore our home you are welcome but do not become a hindrance or you will no longer be welcome here."`

			`Among the commotion of the Hai you feel just as the they all claim to be; you feel at peace here even under all the noise, it is not hard to see why so many Humans visitors have not chosen to return to where they came from. In the delay of waiting for the spaceport coordinator to process your visit; a divide in the crowd forms, it is one of the elders of the council, you would recognise the bright embezzled uniforms among any crowd. Waiting patiently alongside the line of humbled onlookers, the elder invites you to join him in a quiter location, a local office chambers of sorts.`
			`	"Tranquil in our ports is it not? I often find solace in walking amongst the masses." says the elder of the Hai whilst leading you into an area normally restricted for captains, all while attracting all kinds of odd looks from those who cannot figure out what interest an elder has in a ship captain. "Where are you bringing me? I don't get the impression that elders often have chats with civilian captains," you question. He quickly responds, "I had thought you could guess from our last encounter. We have yet another delicate matter that may require an outsiders touch, and you proved very helpful last time."`
			choice
				`	"Have the pirate raiders returned then?"`
				`	"And what makes you think I would jump whenever somebody needs me?"`
					goto "snarky"
			`	"No, no they haven't; this matter is of greater urgency," he says, "one that requires delicate political handling between two neighboring species." You have to ask, "But if this is political and so urgent, why am I here? I'm just a ship captain, one that comes from a species not involved in either side of this."`
			`	He responds, "On the contrary I believe we might require a mediator to represent a neutral perspective on the matter. Besides, even here all the chatter has been on the alien incursion into the war, and of you leading the first fleet into the territories lost to those 'Pug'"`

				`	"I'll have to trust you on my worth in the negotiations, but I'll help."`

					decline
			label "snarky"
			`	He stops walking right as you approach a flight of stairs, and turns to meet your gaze. "Forgive me, I didn't mean to imply expectation," he says, "I would only like to run through the situation with you, if you would?". "What form does this latest emergency take on?" you ask, "A slight diplomatic crisis between the Hai and a humble species known as the Irm" he responds.`

				`	"I know of them, what do you mean by crisis?"`
					goto "explain"
				`	"I don't like the way you use 'slight' with 'crisis'"`
			label "slight crisis"
			`	He lets out a boisterous laugh before exclaiming, "I do appreciate humor among those around me, to find joy even in the midst of an uncertain future is admirable. Today it may be slight, but anything that threatens the long standing peace we have maintained is a crisis to anybody proactively looking towards the future of those generations we may leave in our departure."`
			`	"What is it that happened exactly, what do you need of me?"`
				goto "explain"
			label "irm"
			`	"I didn't expect you to know of them, we try not to expose our neighbors as they prefer their isolation." he says, "In saying that however, they are not difficult to stumble upon on ones own."`
			`	You respond, "Well, I haven't stumbled onto any species who go by "Irm", "You see captain, the path leading into their territory shares the very path into our space, there happens to be a second wormhole in the Waypoint system.."`
			choice
				`	"Why don't you tell me what exactly happened?"`
				`	"I'm sorry, I'm not interested in getting in the middle here."`
					decline
			label "explain"
			`	He gives a look of deep thought, as if trying to find the words on how to phrase the situation. "What happened recently was not the doing of the Unfettered, and to our knowledge no crime of intent. It sparked when a Human and Hai crewed merchant vessel was caught by pirates on the return from a trade run through the Desolation Trail.." Abruptly he cut off and side tracks to clarify, "That is the title attributed to the perilous pathway that allows travel between our two territories. That has been the title for all the trail runners anyway, for longer than I've been elder."`
			`	"But what more of the incident?" You ask`
			`	He continues "Oh yes, well after their travels along the trail and found themselves in pursuit by pirates, the lead they maintained ahead was thinning after entering Waypoint, helpless onlookers fled the system in fear of the pirates. It's unclear why exactly they were unable to retreat into central Hai space but regardless, they found themselves traveling through the second wormhole into Irm space, the rest of what we know is piecemeal of what the Irm have disclosed. We do know that whatever happened on the other side of that wormhole did not do us any favors, they demand negotiations with our council, much of which has departed rather recently. I insisted on staying to focus on more terrestrial matters, however I've been informing myself on your doings within our space and of what I know of your significance within Human space, I believe your curiously intermeddling touch could be of use."`
			`	"Please travel to the Solum system and tell them Kaiya sent you and that you are to participate in the negotiations. the Irm may not be willing include you in this but make sure the elders understand that I sent you, they will request for you once they know."`
